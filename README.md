# Web ML Demonstrator

## About
Web ML Demonstrator is a machine learning demonstrator running purely on the client browser. All algorithms are implemented in JavaScript for the purpose of this demonstrator. They are not optimized for high performance and don't have all the functionality of state-of-the-art implementations. The main purpose of this demonstrator is to be used as a tool when teaching and explaining machine learning and machine learning related concepts.
